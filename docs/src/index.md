# StorageGraphs

StorageGraphs is a package for storing hierarchical data in graphs in a non-redundant way.
This package aims to be useful when one has a combination of data and metadata or parameters
and the use of tables would lead to a lot of redundancy in the corresponding columns.

## Getting started

### Installing

To install the package, use the following command inside the Julia REPL:
```
]add StorageGraphs
```
To load the package, use the command:
```julia
using StorageGraphs
```
